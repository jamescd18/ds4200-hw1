    <p>
      James Chang-Davidson is a computer scientist and technology leader. Originally from
      California, James loves going on long wandering walks and dog watching in the park. He is
      currently based in Boston and capitalizes on every warm day available to go dog watching on
      the esplanade. When it gets cold, James likes making sushi and dreaming of the day when he
      will be able to get a dog of his own.
